Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.

It's also not really very well made. When you put a bulb in it, the socket sags so one end of the bulb is visible. Overall it's a bit flimsy.",0

This set is a good compromise between the cheap wrenches that don't fit very well and the professional-grade stuff that costs two or three times as much. I won't use these very often -- but tools that help me get the job done quickly (and without any bad language or skinned knuckles) are well worth it.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I recently got this HTC Portamate PM1000 mobile base and a Delta 50-345.  The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.",0

It gives off good enough light - not particularly very bright but bright enough to illuminate dim areas where ambient light will be available.  One thing to keep in mind that LEDs that are too bright can be a hindrance since they can be blinding reflecting off surfaces inches away where you're likely to use this thing.  Therefore this wouldn't be a great ""lantern"" in the event of a power outage, but instead provides balanced light in tight spots.  It does bend as well so can direct light optimally as you need it.

Metal doors or door frames block out most of the wireless RF energy radiated from the remote door bell button so many folks complain that the range sucks.  With this kit, you can wire in the transmitter inside your house by your original wired doorbell which will trigger the wireless doorbell when someone presses your old wired doorbell button.  Since the wireless transmitter is now inside your house, you get much better transmit range and you can place your remote wireless doorbell much further away upstairs and it will still be triggered.

1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks.
CONS:
1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly.
2. Runs very hot and noisy.
3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily.
TIPS:
1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time.
2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens.",0

The item works well and the cling is good and fairly stable. It won't cling to everything though so keep that in mind and instead use a small piece of electrical or duct tape if you need to.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Motion sensors are great for different areas around the house.  Couple of places we use them for are in the garage/storage rooms.  Basically a place you're going to go into often that you don't want to have to flip a light.  Works great when carrying something.  The other place that works well is a pantry/bathroom.

There are a couple of modes here that are nice, including the ambient mode which basically will not trigger if the room is already light enough, this is pretty great.  You can also trigger it on manually which is great if you know you are going to be in a room for awhile and are worried about the sensor picking you up (although this sensor is quite sensitive -- and has different settings for the size of the room).

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.

These jobs included drilling in stainless steel and even as the bit broke through the work the DeWalt did not stall and the chuck held the number 3 bit flawlessly.
I only had one surprise with the DeWalt and that was that the clutch functions only on the high speed setting.

Also, while the Tekton has a flip-up wire catch at the bottom to hold the tool closed, the HKP has a slightly clumsy but perfectly effective thumb catch at the top, just below the cutter head - it works from either side, making the tool left- as well as right-handed.

The tool has a very comfortable soft plastic grip.  It feels solid and works effectively.  It does lack the Tekton's limiter screw.  It would not cut the only bolt I tried it on (neither does the Tekton), but scored it enough to guide an oscillating blade.",0

Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.

The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"INSTALLATION TIPS:
1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious.",0

The strainer has a slight tolerance defect that is easy to fix. The bottom of the strainer is slight bowed up holding the stopper too slightly too high so the water leaks out. Put the strainer on top of the open jaws of a vice and center a socket  over the stopper handle at the center of the strainer then hitting it downward.

BTW., if the reviewer is that worried about heat dissipation, he should hurry up and get these because the old halogen lights in recessed ceiling cans get way to hot for my comfort level. Even the heat protection devises to make them safe for installation in attic spaces don't do that good of a job.

Not sure why he had such failure. I'm not sure if LED's can be used outside, in wet exposures. Curious to know how the guy who said they fit in the Malibu (exterior) lights from the boxed store are holding up! I hope well...these would save me a ton of money if I can replace those as well!!",0

The good:  the light defaults to the efficiency mode where the light output changes to the darkness around you.  I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"Editing original review
After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright. I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light. It does not interfere with the light setting I put it in. It has a good light, but it is not as bright as a dim",1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"There are few flashlights as versital as this. Streamlight makes this device in many vetsions. I prefer the sportsman model as the tactical ones include an infra red led. If you have nvg's you might prefer the tactical versions.

There is one other big difference between the military and sportsman models. The military ones will start at the lowest setting once activated. The sportsman is just the opposite.

The various colored leds serve various rolls. Red keeps up your night vision, great for not disturbing your partner at night when nature cqlls. Green is the color human eyes are mosr sensative to. The blue is a bit of an anigima. Someone with more detailed info should be refrenced here.

This my 'go to' flashlight. I keep one at my bedside and another in the end table next to my easy chair.

It's hard to find anything to complain about this. I reccomend you get one or two. I know they are expensive but if your safety depends on a good flashlight, do you really want a $5 cheap wally world one?",0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"It's small (under 2"" side to side) including the diffuser and just over 1"" for the light part. Sure it puts out heat but the diffuser reduces it somewhat and after all it is for halogen lamps.  I have only seen hot ones.  For me, it serves a special purpose by lighting that small area I use for tedious work such as watch repair and fine soldering on tiny electrical things (the scientific word defined as stuff).

While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.  The most important element in this lamp is that it is LED and that makes up for a bunch of missing information.",0

Having a set of earplugs (that can be put in by her unobtrusively) and a set of ear muffs (when she is too scared to be self conscious) is a sanity saver for all of us.

Very comfortable (size small works for my kids, get larger for adults)

At my place, it will be used now and then for thin aluminum angle and strips.
Cuts are not clean, I have to use a file to clean them up and smooth the edges. Were I a professional, this would have been unacceptable, but since I am not, I can live with it (for a while, till perfectionism gets the best of me).
In the past I've used one much more expensive aluminum-cutting blade. We're talking close to $100, and smaller diameter (between 7"" and 8"" -can't remember exactly). Now, THAT blade... The resulting cuts were immaculate, smooth-edged and shiny (not dull and ""barbed"" as with the blade being reviewed), and did not require any further finishing work.

We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.

When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want.

I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.

I found that the sensor pad attachments were as thin as advertised yet fully effective - they fit quite easily under our washing machine, and water heater.  Though the simplicity of the sump pump attachment surprised me, it was none-the-less very sturdy and worked well, so I placed it intentionally low in the sump so it would sound off just before the pump would activate - and it did.  The alarm was just loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor so my recommendation to Gizmode would be to make it even louder - but it still gets the job done.

There is no way to tell from sight that the windows were treated with a spray, no streaks, no thin coated areas of the glass. As long as you use it per the instructions it will work as intended. Now for the bad part. As I was putting on the final coat of the spray it started to sputter. There is about half the can left so no reason for it to seem ""out of gas"". Noticed an accumulation of the  spray in liquid form around the nozzle which seems to be causing the sputtering. If I can get the nozzle to work without sputtering then I can use it to frost one more window. I will try to clean it with warm water see if the nozzle will clean up for use, but if anyone has other suggestions I am open to it. Product would have gotten a 4 or 5 star rating if it wasn't for the sputtering with half the can left.

Edited to give additional star issue with nozzle was resolved :)",0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,I can't say I've ever had an electrician who didn't need a charge for the first couple of months. I had a friend who was a lifetime electrician who had a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers. I was very excited about the idea of using the lithium ion battery and a 2 AAA battery to charge the batteries. I have a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers and had to install a lot of batteries on my electrician's old electrician's motor. I wanted to be able to charge the batteries in the same way that I was able to use a battery powered electrician. So I used the Lutron Lithium Ion Battery. I was very impressed with this battery. I also had no issues with the batteries. I like the fact that I can charge the batteries in the same way as the battery powered electrician. I also like the fact that the battery is not a single AA battery. It is a single,1

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I used to have one that i bought at the big orange boxed store down the street. It worked ok, sometimes too well. It would pull interference seemingly whenever it felt like it. Ripped it out and installed this one, in the master bedroom.

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it.",0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've had one of these for years and I want to get at least one more.  I haven't been able to find them in home improvement stores lately.  You can mount this clamp anywhere on your work bench by simply drilling a hole for the supplied round headed bolt and then countersinking for the bolt head.  When the clamp is not in use the bolt will then drop flush with the work surface.  There's no open hole in the work bench like for a hold fast.  When you want to use it you simply reach under the work surface, push up on the bolt, slide the clamp onto the bolt head and clamp down your piece.  And you can make additional bolts to mount the same clamp at different places simply by rounding the hex head on an ordinary bolt using a grinder.  It's very handy for planing, sanding or any other reason you may want to clamp a piece down away from the edge of your bench.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This chandelier is simply beautiful.  At first I was wondering if the LED light bulbs would reflect nicely from the crystal.  The white light actually reflects and refracts much nicer. I hired an electrician to install this chandelier and another bigger one I bought on Amazon.  The strings with the crystals look difficult to put together but actually not.  If you are a handy man type, once you install the base flushed to the ceiling, it's just a matter of following the labels for the strings and hang them accordingly. My husband and I helped hang the strings.
Even my electrician said, ""wow it's beautiful:"". Definitely worth the money.
A word about the seller 7pm Lighting - given I could't find the electrician who had done work for us - I kept the boxes beyond 30 days before I found and scheduled an electrician.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree.

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I did receive these as a promotion and I really like these gloves. They protect my hands from heat with a pot I took right off the stove and tried them by holding it in my hand. Didn't feel any heat transfer. The silicon grips are great too as I don't feel that my hands are going to slip. Have used them multiple times and they do not transfer heat. I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus.

It does come with a belt clip but DOES NOT come with a spare bit holder on the other side of the tool.  Some Dewalt tools do come with this and some do not.  This one does not.

As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

I've had it for about a year now and I love it. The only reason I didn't buy it was because it's a bit of a pain to install. You have to get it to stand up to the elements and it's really hard to do that with the ratchet. But I'm glad I did. I'll be using it to make wood pieces for my wall or other things that I need to do. It's also a little hard to pull it out of the way. You have to get it on the floor and hold it down while you try to get it to stand up. I'm not sure how",1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"As part of my significant renovation throughout a recently-purchase house, I bought this faucet for my bar sink just two weeks ago.  This faucet was extremely easy to install.  Since I did not have to remove the old faucet (there was no faucet at this sink when I bought the house), it took me all but 10 minutes to have this up and running.  Just put the whole faucet through the sink hole.  Screw in the mounting plate from the below.  Hook up the water supply hoses and you are set.  Please note that I am a fairly typical DIYer not expert, so I think most anybody would be able to install this faucet.

My experience with Amazon has been great.  The box arrived quickly.  Although it is advertised as oil-rubbed bronze, the color is fairly light not as dark as some of the other bronze faucets that I have.  In fact, the picture on Amazon is a lot darker than the actual faucet.  There were also no hoses included with the faucet, so you will need to buy them separately.

Overall, it's a good buy, but only time will tell how it will hold up.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star.",0

I have these in weather proof/resistant enclosures and have good outside WIFI due to an access point I have outside.  I had to drill a 1/2"" hole in the enclosure for the motion sensor to work.  It can not sense anything through plastic or glass.  A plastic bag was successful during testing, but not how I wanted to install it.  For additional weather proofing, I used silicon on areas prone to water intrusion.  To link the sensor to the WEMO switch, I just used IFTT(If this then that website)  and a simple rule mated them well.(If motion detected, then turn on wemo)

Works super.  Turns on lights as desired and sends IFTT alerts as well(though this is hit or miss it seems).

Also, this set up is working with Alexa(amazon echo) so I can say, ""Alexa, turn off cafe lights"" and she goes to work.

As a WIFI sensing device, I suppose the price is as expected, though I feel its more of a 20 something dollar device.",0

The Stainless Steel matches my Decor Range, Kenmore Refrigerator and GE microwave, which is hard to match all of these appliances since every manufacture is a little different.

Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Our house came with an older Moen tub faucet that had been well-used. I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up. The handle came with a plastic adapter to attach it to the original cartridge, since the plastic knob has a horizontal screw holding it on, while this metal handle uses a vertical set-screw.
It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection. About an inch of the stop tube is exposed now, which doesn't look quite right, but again, I think it's due to our setup. I don't want to tear out the tub surround and replumb entire thing.

Second thing is that it didn't even fit.  I'm replacing an original Moen trim kit.  My originial sits flush to the wall.  This one has about a 3.5"" ring that needs to be recessed into the wall by 1/4"" - not something easy to accomplish on an existing tile wall.  I have about a 2"" diameter hole where the valve comes out, but it's not big enough.  You can see what I'm talking about in the product picture - where the handle is attached, you can see that circle there and how it is recessed.

The one nice thing (not that it benefitted me at all) is that this kit tries to replace both old & new Moen configurations by providing several inserts to choose from.  This way you can match it to most Moens regardless of how your current one screws in to the valve.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw.

That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.

Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have learned that the ""GU10"" bulbs, whether they be halogen or LED, are usually much less in price than those regular screw-in (""old fashioned"") bulbs. This little gizmo will convert a GU10 bulb to fit one of those regular fixture sockets. And it does it well! The GU10 bulb has two connector prongs (it's called ""bayonet base"") to connect to the power source, these posts being quite similar to the connectors of old fluorescent ""starters"" in days of yore. But, alas, you may very well be a bit too young to remember those.

I do not know why bulbs with this type of bayonet connector are priced less than the screw-in type, but with using these adapters, your purchases of the GU10 bulbs will be less (usually) than buying bulbs with the regular type base. You'll add about an inch overall to the height (or would that be length) of what the GU10 bulb would be if it were affixed into a bayonet base style socket. But for the most part GU10 bulbs are much shorter than their regular base counterparts - so not a prob.

I'm thinking that you'll recoup your $$$ using these for the very first time (not to mention how much you'll save on electricity if you switch to LED bulbs).",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

It has been two years and the switch is still working great.

Update:
I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.

My only issue is the manual, and it's probably not the manufacturer's fault.  It's the lawyers.  With this litigious society we live in, you can no longer get a manual that tells you what to do and how to do it.  It's always a long laundry list of warnings and cautions.  Due to this, it's nearly impossible to search through the manual on how to actually do something, because that useful tidbit was wedged between the warning about using the saw on a fluorescent tubes and the caution against hand-holding it to cut down tree branches.

I'm pretty sure that if all the lawyer-speak was removed, the instructions would fit on a single sheet of paper.

I've discovered that if I set the blade bevel at 45 degrees, if I were to actually turn it on and bring the blade down, it would shred the aqua-colored plastic table inserts at the center of the cutting surface.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"As with everything, the rechargeable battery will last a long time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to install, so you have to drill down a little to get the batteries in. If you are going to use it for a lot of jobs, it will be a pain. I would recommend using the battery with a strong enough wire. I just put the wire in a little bit and it will be all right. I have no idea how to program it for a lot of jobs, but I'm not going to put it in a shop or garage.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I ultimately ended up sending these back.  Here's why...

In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.

In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change.",0

I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old.

We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts.",0

Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well.

The only tip I should pass along is that the you install a new one, do instal the hose and point the hose at the drain, as close as you can get to the drain) then slowly turn up the water. The first few seconds that the water is running it will throw out some carbon from this filter. The carbon is, of course, completely harmless but its particles are so small that will get trapped in the texture of your shower floor and leave a black mark. It eventually goes away but it might be noticeable to some people.

The other tip I can offer is that this is an effective filter but it clogs up easily. There are only two of us that use the one in the master bath and it only lasts 4 months (once it lasted 5 months, I got al excited but the next one only lasted 5 months again).

They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.",0

Some of the nice features of this light: It's very lightweight, very bright (75,000 candlepower), run time is very good for this much light output.  Well made, quality construction.
Some of the cons about this light:  Plastic lens (seems only SureFire will give you a genuine Pyrex, glass lens these days) and the spot/flood range isn't really that much of a difference (Mag's spot/flood produces a SPOT or a FLOOD).  The Streamlight has a very coarse adjustment range, really being all the same style output, with very LITTLE difference in the SPOT / FLOOD.  This isn't as bad as it sounds as the light produced is a very good, pure white light, I'd just like to see more variation in the range, but I'm being picky here.

The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it was rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of sets of halogen track lights years ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb.

But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other lights and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulbs when it comes to lighting up my room, and it's just as good as one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white walls and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulbs they replaced.

In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.

My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

I bought 2 pair of the Shop Fox slides to use for a custom closet build. They were easy to install and when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blum-Universal-Mounting-Bracket/dp/B002K9TAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blum Universal Mounting Bracket</a>&nbsp;i was easily able to mount them to the base of my 1\2 plywood shelves. The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.

Pro's
 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them
 Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes
 Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go

Con's
 If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out
 Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level
 Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot

Conclusion
For an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price.",0

Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is a very good LED lamp for the price. Most people will find the light a bit harsh and the range of color temperatures a bit arbitrary. People who like to fiddle with stuff will enjoy this lamp. Let me list the pros and cons.

Pros:
The lamp is lightweight and seems pretty sturdy and stable on the base.
The light is very steady and there is no flicker.
The controls are easy to learn and access.
The finish is nice.
The lamp head is long enough for most desktop applications.
The lamp head can be pivoted and tilted to a wide range of angles.
The head can be pointed backward to bounce the light off the wall for an indirect lighting effect.

Cons:
The lamp head can only be rotated 45 degrees left and right on the base.
The two middle color temperatures are quite similar and the whitest temperature is very harsh and almost bluish.
The lamp uses a power block instead of a direct plug in.
The styling of the lamp probably won't fit with most desk styles. It is sort of  nouveu but also sort of sharp angled.

I will be using the lamp for some photographic work and it is very good for setting white balance and exposure for close ups. My camera can really tell the difference in the colors, and the range of dimming is very wide. I am not sure whether the lamp has any eye protecting value as stated, or not. But at least you never have to change a light bulb!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Excellent adapter for my recess light. Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even has it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminals of my recess can which has the gx23 connector and it was 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it.
Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess lights in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wires are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing means cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which has the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I found the Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutters to be very aggressive. The first one bit in, snapped one of the four teeth right off.

So far the third one is going and cut and removed about two dozen spot welds, but is noticeably becoming worn down. The initial aggressiveness has worn off.

For the money... I have found better spot weld bits and will most likely not reorder these as they definitely don't last as I expected. Sorry, but facts are facts. I'm not that impressed. As I mentioned in the review under ""Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in.

I had to resort to putting the arbor into a vice, clamping it down, TIGHT, and removing the bit with a pair of vice grips. The threads are common right handed threads so there should be no doubt one would remove the bit in a left handed motion. Every time I removed a bit, same thing. This is caused by the right handed direction the bit turns when removing spot welds. Understandable, but they really become torqued in place.

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above.",0

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made.

Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)

If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.",0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,CG,"These re-branded German pliers feel better than the originals. I will admit that I have been using the cheaper ones for the past few months. The basic design of the re-branded pliers is a little awkward to use, but they work well. The two-finger tips are great for fastening a screw to the back of the tool and it is a little tricky to use for just about anything else. I am not sure if they are a good design for the tool, but I would be fine with it. I will definitely buy again. I have a few other re-branded German pliers and they work great. I have to say that I like the color and the feel of the re-branded ones, but they are not as sharp as the originals. I would have to give these a 5 star if I could.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

Don't let the quirky design lure you in. Look to more basic type tile saws.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/",0

They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"The work light work OK so far. It charges via USB charger (they include both wall and car chargers). The charging port does not have a cover, so I am afraid it will get dirty or wet and it will prove fatal for the light.

The three moving lights can either be folded along the main body of the flashlight, or they can be spread out, but they cannot be brought up more than 90 degrees to the surface and cannot concentrate all four lights on one spot. I found it irritating, especially in tight spaces, where it would be nice to fold one of the sides more to the center to fit in a light corner. The magnet is strong enough to hold the flashlight horizontally, but just barely - it is very easy to knock it down.

The battery life was relatively good so far, and it charges rather fast, too. When the battery gets low, it turns off without any notice. You can turn it on again for a few seconds to find a charger. It does not charge and light up at the same time - if you plug it in and turn on, it will not be charging at all. Empty battery will stay empty battery.

The most irritating thing is that it has one button for multiple modes. When you first turn it on, it only lights up the end, as a regular flashlight. But when you are done, and want to turn it off and press the button, it lights up the three sides, effectively blinding you, unless you unfold the sides and direct them away. It needs on power button and one mode button.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet.  Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic).",0

Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools.",0

The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last.",0

I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!",0

I had a lot of trouble with the drill itself, so I decided to give it a try. It worked great, and was easy to install.

The drill does not have a 2-piece screw driver. I have had to use a second set of hex-driver bits to get the screwdriver to work properly. The hexdriver bit is well made, and looks great.

The drill is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it works perfectly. Much better than the other options on ebay, and for 15$ it may not be worth it in materials but it is definitely worth it in usefulness.",0

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a similar model at Home Depot that was advertised to be 4.5"" and had no sockets in it.  The one I got was 4.5"" and the one I received was just a bit smaller.  I'll try to figure out how to replace it for my kid.  I'm sure it won't work.

This bulb is very bright and very easy to install.  The included instructions were fairly easy to understand, but I didn't get the wiring instructions from Home Depot.  The instructions are also not as clear as I had hoped.

Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I.

(Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This thing is legit.  It's like the extinguishers you used to see in schools.  I think few government buildings keep them around anymore, having gone to dry chemical extinguishers as codes become more and more restrictive.  I do have typical ABC extinguishers in my garage and kitchen, but I bought this to have upstairs to fight my way to my kids' rooms in that fire that wakes you up in the middle of the night--you know, then one where  you hear the smoke detector going off and open your bedroom door to find your hallway walls and carpet completely involved.  I have no doubt this will work great for that.  I don't plan on having to extinguish any grease or chemical fires in the upstairs portion of my home.  Note that it requires a 100 psi compressor to charge (or a really good manual pump).  I opted to use my little compressor which coincidentally kicks off at 100 psi.  When re-attempting to get that last few psi in there, it did spit a little water back into the air hose, which is not ideal.  I recommend either using a sturdy hand pump or a compressor which is regulated to something well above 100 psi.
In an age where everything is made in China, and expected to be tossed out after a year, it's refreshing to find a quality American-made product which should last a lifetime.

I bought a package of 6 bulbs for $7.90,  installed them and was so impressed with the quality and brightness, I went back and bought four more packages to give to friends and relatives.  These are high-quality bulbs.

They FEEL sturdy. I like LED bulbs that have the ceramic ""band"" around the bottom.  They're less fragile and I have cats!  The metal base is solidly connected to the bulb and it screws in to the socket with a tight connection.  They come on instantly with no flickering.  The light streams from the bulbs in all directions so that you get full coverage.

And they're BRIGHT. I was hesitant to buy them because the package is marked ""warm white.""  I prefer ""daylight"" or ""natural light"" bulbs because they give off more light.  I don't want ""ambiance.""  I just want to be able to see where I'm going.  However, these produce a strong, natural looking light with very little yellow in it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

I was worried that it was going to be a big deal and not something I would use on a regular basis.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was because it is very bulky.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,I purchased the MM 520 because it seemed like a reputable company one year ago.  I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.  What a joke......,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,CG,"If you ever think about using an electric drill, you know it's important to know what you're talking about.  The drill itself is very powerful, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.  The drill also comes with a small 2-volt battery, and it's very easy to set up.  I also like the fact that the drill has a nice rubber grip on the motor, and that it has a convenient grip on the motor when you're pulling it around.  This is a nice feature, and a great addition to any drill.  The drill is a good drill, and one that I use often.

The drill is a bit small, but not too big.  I've had it for a while now, and the size of the drill is good enough to hold in my hand.  I prefer that the drill is smaller than my older drill, but that's not really a big deal.

The motor is very quiet, and the motor is very quiet.  The motor does a good job of controlling the speed, and I find that it is very quiet.  I don't have any problems with it, and it's not going to hurt my head.  I'm very happy with the motor.  I just wish it had a bit bigger to hold it.  It's a very quiet unit.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry.",0

The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"As some of the other reviewers has stated, this is definitely a version 1.0 product.  I'm on an Android phone and the app is missing the ability to view the camera remotely. You can't simply use the Skybell app to see if everything is OK at the door.  The motion detection doesn't work, and you have to press the door bell before it'll send you an alert.  This was supposed to be working when they shipped.  I emailed them directly to check before ordering.

The Android app is crashing when you try to configure some things.  Android tablets are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile devices inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device. This is limiting as you always have to have your phone near you.  Hope they fix this soon.

I had my WiFi access point configured for N-Only as I do not have older 802.11b/g devices.  It never connected to the 2.4Ghz N-Only radio.  I had to go back into the WiFi AP and reconfigure to support the older 802.11b/g devices.  It says it's N compatible, but looks like it may not be.  This delayed the install procedure as I tried 5 times to get the device connected to the WiFi before taking a look at the WiFi AP settings.  So if you're having problems connecting it to your WiFi, double check this setting.

I think the concept is a really great idea and hopefully these items are simply version 1.0 growing pains.  Wait a few months for the product to mature.  If they can get the rest of the features in and fix the app bugs, it'll be a cool product.",0

The blade is a solid, strong, straight edge.  It is not stiff like a regular saw.  I use it to cut concrete with no problems.  I have the most common type of saw and it is a solid blade.  I use it on most of my projects and for small projects.  It is very versatile.  I have had no problems with the saw.  I am very pleased with this tool.

Pros:
-Good for work
-Excellent for small projects
-Lightweight
-Doesn't seem to take up a lot of room

Cons:

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries.",0

I guess that a good deal of torque is applied to the single nut and bolt holding it in place, and it loosens easily, at least when installed without Locktite as my plumber did.  It's almost impossible to get at this nut.  I could feel it in order to hand-tighten it blindly, but I couldn't get it secured.  I thought getting a wrench on it without a special plumber's faucet tool would be impossible.  I was therefore nearly ready to give up and request a service call, that surely would have cost $100, when I saw this product.  It came in 2 days, and my faucet was secured rigidly (pun intended, sorry) in 2.01 days -- a minor miracle from my desperate perspective.
I wish it had multiple inserts for different size nuts because if they're mounted flush, I don't see how it could reach the smaller sizes, as designed with the smaller-sized wrenches nested within and below the largest.  That didn't matter in my case, but it would limit the usefulness somewhat under some circumstances.
Other reviews would lead one to believe that it's too flimsy to be useful, and that's certainly UNtrue.  The construction is plenty strong enough for hand-tightening or loosening, which is all it's designed for and which should almost always be sufficient.  I can see how you might crack or break it if you tried to turn the lower end with a pipe wrench.  The slot, which is the genius-inspired part of this tool, could allow it to deform under that kind of torque, but it's not designed for that use.

I have purchased over a dozen small solar powered outdoor lights in the last few years. Whats not to like in a light that powers up from the sun and helps you see things at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It gets full sun most of the day and it lasts an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered events the light ran all night.

All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen models of lights from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hours on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and runs about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line posts on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Bought this sturdy 1/2"" shank bit to create my own Slatwall shelving from an unused laminated kitchen shelf. I only needed a couple of shelves for the limited space and buying a full sheet of Slatwall was prohibitively expensive and would delay the project.

Technically, this cuts a T-slot that's a bit larger than true Slatwall, but it works.

I ran the melamine shelf board through my table saw with the blade raised to just under the depth of the cutter's eventual depth. Then I moved the fence over and cut it again to create a 1/4"" dado. This removed a good deal of material so the cutter didn't have to work so hard.

I then used my router table and its rip fence to create the T-slot. Cut some scrap first to assure the proper depth. Worked like a charm.

A 2'x4' piece of Slatwall goes for $58. This $18 cutter and some scrap 3/4"" melamine did the trick and I can use the cutter again for a long time. And I have no unusable leftover Slatwall pieces. Nor did I have to wait for the Slatwall to be delivered. (It's not stocked locally.)

The patterns and colors are mesmerizing! The push of a button takes you to the next color. There are 8 different color patterns taking you from a multi pattern to red, to blue to green. Pick one that fits you mood.
This lighted orb also contains a speaker and an input to plug in your mp3 player, computer, your phone, etc so you can enjoy your music at the same time.
The projector can be operated off a wall outlet via the included outlet adapter or it can be operated off a USB device. You can take this almost anywhere to enjoy the hypnotic waves of color. It automatically turns off after an hour. I do wish there was a switch to deactivate the auto off for times when you want it to stay on longer.

I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.

I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

There is also a instruction booklet on the back that does not explain how to use the light.  There is also a section on the back that does not explain how to use the light.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I added one of these hardwired Kidde/Firex CO alarms in our basement in the general area of the oil burner just in case there is ever a problem with flue gasses backing up. I have it interconnected with two other KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms and four Kidde/Firex SA320CN Dual-Sensor smoke alarms located throughout the rest of the house. This CO alarm has a 9v battery backup in case of power interruption and will sound along with the other interconnected CO alarms when one of them detects a high CO level. It has its own distinct sound pattern to differentiate it from the sound the smoke alarms make. However, this CO alarm is apparently designed so that it will not also sound the interconnected smoke alarms, which would mean if you only had one of these CO alarms installed in a remote location of your home, like a basement, it may not be able to alert people in other areas of the building when it activates. So, the ideal solution would be to have one of these interconnected CO alarms on each floor in addition to smoke alarms. The alarm has a built in end of life notification feature that alerts you when it needs replacement with two chirps every 30-seconds. The Amazon product description above says this occurs after seven years of operation, but the actual User's Guide that came with it says ten years, so not sure which is correct. Overall, this CO alarm seems decently made and was fairly reasonably priced. Of course I hope to never actually have it activate from high CO levels in our home, but it's good to know it is there just in case.

Update: According to Kidde's website, the KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms manufactured as of 2013 now have a 10-year end of life cycle, not 7-years as indicated in the product description above.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a whole new way of looking at wood building and other projects. I also bought a fancy jig system, then realized this adhesive is the only thing I need. I lined the inside of a cabinet, fastened a dummy door pull to the closet, and added a 3/4 inch piece of wood to the bottom of a door in less than ten minutes. Very fast and very strong!
  As suggested by another reviewer, I remove the tube after squeezing out an inch of adhesive and capping it. I store the tubes in the freezer in a vacuum sealed jar. Oh, and customer service by Franklin international is awesome.

Edit: After a using it for over a year, I am more aware of the limitations at home and in my beginners woodshop. It did not replace the pocket screws or the dowelmax, but complements them. It is unbelievable when I have 2 clean surfaces to be joined with enough flat surface area to hold. These are critical factors to remember.

The short set time for the 30 and 75 glues, though, means I have to get things aligned perfectly and very quickly--which as a novice woodworker is almost never! I just assembled a downdraft sanding box trying the 300 (5 min set time) which worked better for me on this kind of project. A more skilled person would use it for even more things. the biggest advantage is not having to wait overnight for the glue to set before moving on with a project. You are supposed to wait 24 hours before ""stressing"" it but it is strong enough to sand or whatever within 15 minutes.

 I just used a tube of the 75 (partially used) and a new tube of the 300 that had been stored in my freezer and almost 1 1/2 years past the expiration date. Very good product IMO.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.",0

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"This is a very bright light that is marred by an oversimplified design on the elastic cord that hold the lights in place. But let's start at the beginning. This is a very nice Energizer headset that could have been a lot better except for American corporate insistence on not quite getting things as well as they might have.  They list their light at 150 lumens, which is respectable and serviceable, but certainly not one of the  brightest headsets on the markets. They claim to have made a technological adjustment that makes this four times brighter. But they aren't clear about this. If this is four times brighter, that would mean it is a 600 lumens. If it is 600 lumens, then why not say it? I suspect because it really is just a 150 lumens headset, but they want you to think it is rather more. Regardless, this bright enough for most lighting needs. Where it fails is the headband. I have a couple of other headlamps, and in both instances they constructed the headset with several pieces of elastic. This allows for a couple of things. It provides a more stable perch on the head, which it most certainly provides. It also provides a more comfortable perch for the headlamp. This is simply not a very comfortable headset to wear. The lone band really cuts into your skin when holding it. If you tried to wear this on your head  for any length of time you would begin to experience discomfort and most probably a pressure headache.

This is not a bad headlamp, but there are much better ones available for just about any need. I'm something of an Energizer/Duracel loyalist (I find the two brands to be almost indistinguishable from one another and I will continue to use both this and Duracel products, but this isn't one of Energizer's stronger products.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.

I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.

This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.

The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.

With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.

The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I have no doubt that this is an amazing showerhead. I was confident in this when I got this showerhead because I have other Grohe fixtures in my home, and they are awesome. So, I have every confidence in the quality of this fixture.

My problem with it is that while it says ""retro-fit,"" which would seem to indicate that it can be retrofitted to just about any shower out there, assuming that the shower has enough room to fit the unit, which mine did. The problem (for me, anyway) is that the fixture is so heavy, it needs to be anchored into the wall with huge screws both on the top of the unit and the bottom. So, you have to have the structure inside the wall of your shower in order to have something to anchor those screws into. I happen to have an older home, and while my shower was re-done recently, (not by me), the structural integrity just isn't there. Luckily, the plumber I hired to put this unit in, realized this before he got too far into it.

So, the bottom line is that, again, while this is a ""retro-fit"" showerhead, it will not work for every shower, and you need to be very careful to know whether or not your shower can work with this unit...not just in terms of size, but in terms of structural integrity inside the walls...before you buy it.

I was unable to install this unit, but I'm still giving this a four star rating. Why? Just based on my previous experience with Grohe products...knowing how great the quality is with this company. I also thoroughly inspected all the parts of this when the plumber opened the package, and all parts for this are heavy, well made, and high-quality. I'm keeping this unit because I plan to re-do my bathroom one day soon, and I am definitely going to use this once I do.",0

It works great, but it is not as bright as the old one.  I have to use a larger diameter bulb, which is a lot better.  It has a very nice white base, but I like the white base on my new one.

The only issue I have is that it is not as bright as the old one.  I put it in a dimmer, and it is still dim, but it is only about 10 watts.  I would be much happier if it was a little brighter.  It would be better if it was a little brighter.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like.",0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"Here are just some of the things you can do to help keep your hands clean.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it.",0

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Considering how ancient the unit was that this replaced, a life of 2 years was a disappointment.  The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Up front, these lights are not mellow yellow, they are WHITE. But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I really love these night lights! They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I was an electrician/electrical contractor for 25 years. I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)

Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.

The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

When it goes on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door.
Update!
 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors.",0

I figured they would be fair to moderately bright and maybe be able to be changed from white to colors. I had no idea that they were programmable, had presets you can make, the controls are more than robust, they are amazing! As you can see in the video and photos these things can be made to shine brighter or dimmer, and any color combination you can think of or of course the solid colors of Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. The ability to change the settings are endless and was fun to play with.
What I like is these are bright enough to be used to illuminate a work bench or a working area, and also as decorative lighting like I am going to use them for.
These LED lights are more than I had hoped for and are amazing for the price. They are on a strip which you can cut to length and is adhesive backed. I will be using some extra strength double sided tape to help hold it in place.

If you need LED strip lighting for indoor use, this is definitely something you can use and able to do more than people think! My son wants some now for his room to put up.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My grandpa got me (and the rest of the grandkids) an economy version one of these on his last trip to Switzerland in the 80s. I still have it.

The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:

- There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.

- It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.

I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!

In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I've used this for years on my front lights to welcome us home. In the driveway an infrared type light makes sense, but on the front lights using this timer in the automated setting is best.

Installation:
I fist use a contactless voltmeter to find the Hot Wire (has 120v current)  hooked up to the light switch and mark it with nail polish. Then go turn off your circuit breaker. Next go an connect the BLACK wire to the one which you just marked with nail polish. You will need to find your neutral, which is generally white and NOT connected to a standard two pole light switch. Just find the neutral and some white 14 gauge solid white wire and create a pig tail; then connect it to the white wire with an electric wing nut. Lastly, connect the blue LOAD wire to the wire which was connected to your switch. Sometimes you might have a green wire which was a ground wire. I just loop it around the screw as I reinstall all the wires. I also tend to wrap everything in electric tape as I go to ensure no shorts anywhere.

Go to google maps and get your current location, you will need the first two numbers of your Lattitude and Longitude.  Press the big frond button for 3 seconds to enter configuration mode and follow the single directions. It's mostly updating the year, month and day, next the time and lastly the latitude and longitude. Lastly I don't like the back light on all the time, so I turn that off. It still glows for 8 seconds whenever you press any button. I use the defaul P01 which turn on at sunrise and off at 11pm in your time zone and automatically adjusts for day light savings time.

- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I needed a new headlamp to replace one from a big box store which broke easily.  I chose this one because it has a separate switch for the red light.  I am an amateur astronomer, and I use a red light when I am observing to protect my night vision when reading star maps and eyepiece focal lengths.  It takes about 30 mins for your eyes to become dark-adapted, and thus able to see very faint deep sky objects.  A flash of white light ruins night vision for another 20-30 mins, and my previous headlamp had to cycle through 3 white light settings just to get to red, and this was a nuisance to me and anyone who was observing with me.  THIS headlamp allows me to switch on the red light without any possibility of turning on the white light, and I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for my wife.
Enough about red light, now I'll tell you what I like about the white light.  I had to do some work in the attic, and I used this headlamp to see what I was doing in the dark attic.  It starts of with the brightest white light setting at first one when you press the white light switch.  If you quickly press the switch again it goes to a dimmer setting for longer battery life if you're going to have it on for an extended period.  There are 3 brightness levels which can be accessed by pressing the switch again within about 5 seconds.  I am very pleased to tell you that you don't have to cycle through all these brightness levels to turn it off, because after being on in any brightness mode for more than 5 seconds results in it simply switching off with ONE press of the switch.  All this and a LIFETIME WARRANTY for an incredibly low price.  Stop looking now and buy this one -- you won't be disappointed.",0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,CG,"I have always wanted one of these, and it is a great deal for the price.  The other two I had were the Schlage and the Porter Cable, so it is a nice quality product.  It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Pros:
-Good quality;
-Low cost;
-Excellent;

Cons:
-Does not have a multi function button;
-Wish list;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I, too, have been a DeWalt user for many years, having moved to their brand when I felt the Makita line went substandard.  After deciding to move up to an 18 volt product, I spent months conducting research, going to wood shows, and actually trying out numerous lithium ion and non-litium ion 18 volt tools.  My final choice was this kit.  Here are some of the reasons why:

Batteries:  18 volt lithium ion.  Fantastic idea to go with lithium ion.  The charge lasts longer and will not dissipate over time.  In addition, the battery design (outer housing) is smart.  I do not need to click two buttons on the side to disengage the battery from any of the tools.  I simply need to click the one button on the front of the battery and the battery slides out.  Because my hands are small, this makes all the difference in the world.

Drill Driver - For my hands, this was the most ergonomically correct grip I found.  This drill feels great, does not fatigue my hands after many hours of use, and does not weigh as much as the competition.  The 18 volt battery does not add as much weight as I thought it would, and the tool balances in my hand perfectly.  In addition, I didn't think I would like having LED's built into the drill, but I really do like the additional light when I am working.  Excellent drill all around.

Recip Saw - Again, excellent feel and power.  I have used this saw to cut through a variety of materials without any lag.  The one button saw change also adds a nice touch.  Grip and balance are excellent, with the battery adding the perfect amount of counterweight to the entire setup.

As I mentioned earlier, I looked at all of the kits available.  For the price and the product you receive, I don't think you could find a better value for your money than this kit.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this LED CRLight 4W Dimmable LED Filament Candle Light Bulb,2700K Warm White 400LM, E12 Candelabra Base Lamp C35 Bullet Top, Clear Glass Cover, 40W Incandescent Replacement light!  This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills!

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.",0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.

I read directions in manual just because wise thing to do. I opened the fly nut 6 or 7 times and ran it until air was out of hydraulic line. After retightened I decided to check oil on the stick after reading reviews about oil being at lowest line from factory. I tilted it up on end and put 7mm hex in nut and will not move. I mean will not turn loose. So I called 800 number. Got a very pleasant gentlemen on phone that told me that's because they use thread lock so it will not leak in transit. He said you have to give the hex wrench a hard tap to break the glue or use a lock creasant  wrench (vise-grips) to lock on the round end of hex dip stick and give that a tap to loosen. This is not in the manual. Word of advise: Do not strip your 7mm hex nut, use the lock wrench and tap it and behold it is loose. Then screw it out with hex wrench that is included. I found the hydrologic oil to still be between the lines. Then I spent about 3 hours splitting about half a cord of wood. it went through my hard sweet gum ball wood like butter( if you get it with the grain). Stacked it and covered it and done. Also use some kind of silicone spray on the black and red back and forth stuff. Oil will cause wood chips to stick to it. And it helps to prevent screeching sounds.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I needed to replace my existing Malibu driveway lights, they had become broken not working and mainly a pain to upkeep. When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.

I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking.",0
